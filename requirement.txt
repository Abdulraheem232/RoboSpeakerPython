Python RoboSpeaker App Requirements
Overview
The Python RoboSpeaker App is a text-to-speech application that utilizes Python's speech synthesis capabilities to convert text into spoken words. The app aims to provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to input text and hear it spoken back to them.

Functional Requirements
1. Text Input
The app shall provide a text input field for users to enter text.
The text input field shall support multiple lines of text.
2. Speech Synthesis
The app shall use a speech synthesis library (e.g., pyttsx3) to convert text into spoken words.
The app shall support multiple voices and languages.
3. Audio Output
The app shall play the synthesized audio through the system's default audio output.
The app shall provide an option to save the synthesized audio as a file.
4. User Interface
The app shall have a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built using a Python GUI library (e.g., tkinter).
The GUI shall display the text input field, a button to start speech synthesis, and a button to save the audio file.
5. Error Handling
The app shall handle errors that occur during speech synthesis, such as invalid text input or audio output errors.
The app shall display error messages to the user in a clear and concise manner.
Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance
The app shall respond quickly to user input and speech synthesis requests.
The app shall not consume excessive system resources.
2. Security
The app shall not store any user data or text input.
The app shall not transmit any data over the internet.
3. Usability
The app shall be easy to use for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
The app shall provide clear and concise instructions for use.
System Requirements
1. Operating System
The app shall be compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
2. Python Version
The app shall be compatible with Python 3.6 and later versions.
3. Dependencies
The app shall require the following dependencies:
pyttsx3 for speech synthesis
tkinter for GUI development
Development Environment
1. IDE
The app shall be developed using a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.
2. Version Control
The app shall use Git for version control.
3. Testing
The app shall be tested using unit tests and integration tests.
Publishing to GitHub
1. Repository Creation
Create a new repository on GitHub for the Python RoboSpeaker App.
2. Code Upload
Upload the app's code to the GitHub repository.
3. README File
Create a README file that includes the app's requirements, installation instructions, and usage instructions.
4. License
Choose a suitable open-source license for the app (e.g., MIT License).
By following these requirements, you can create a Python RoboSpeaker App that is functional, user-friendly, and easy to maintain.
